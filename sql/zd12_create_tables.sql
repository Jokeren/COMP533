	First, choose 10000 samples by join movie, person, genre, and assign.
	Second, take genre, actor, director, actress, isAdult, releaseYear as parameters to calculate jaccard similarity respectively.
	Third, calculate the total similarity. Every parameter has its own weight.
	Fourth, combine similarity and ratings as a recommendation value.
